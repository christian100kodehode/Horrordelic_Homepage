It was known by names such as Hades or Erebus which have become synonymous with the concept of ‘Hell’.\n\nThe Underworld was a structured place. The souls of the dead were sent to various realms based on how they were judged: blameless heroes to Elysium, the evil to Tartarus and those who were neither good nor bad to the Fields of Asphodel. To safely travel from the world of the living to that of Hades, the soul needed to cross the Styx (the River of Hate) on a boat steered by a grim ferryman known as Charon.",

Each dream I have is represented on the tracks.\n\n In his own words he will present you his journey:\n\n“Babayaga” is an old fairytale that was created decades ago. This tale is about an old Creature which comes from the depth of Hell, the son of Dark Magic … Pure and hungry...\n\nThe tracks from 1-12 represent the fight between good and evil, losing the sanity...  Visited by my old friend Baba I was influenced by energies beyond my understanding, performing this highest level of magic and active meditation to bring devastation and healing.

For listening, experiencing, following & supporting my music. Even if you just tuned in to this project after 15 years ... THANK YOU!  \n\nEven if you are listening & following my music since the very start... THANK YOU! \n\nThis album is my 4th solo album. And with every new solo album I feel that I have pushed my Emotionpsy to the next level. Well it sure happened again with this one, for my 15 years of this project... I feel I have reached another level of emotions , atmospheres and experimental psytrance music.\n\n I would like to leave you all with these words yet again : \n\n'You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest.
