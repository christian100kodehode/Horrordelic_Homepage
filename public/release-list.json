The souls of the dead were sent to various realms based on how they were judged: blameless heroes to Elysium, the evil to Tartarus and those who were neither good nor bad to the Fields of Asphodel. To safely travel from the world of the living to that of Hades, the soul needed to cross the Styx (the River of Hate) on a boat steered by a grim ferryman known as Charon.",

With his V.A's he always tries to push new talent together with the established ones, to get the people to recognize and see how talented these upcoming artists truly are. \n\n And with this one it's no different. \n\n Again he presents you with 9 tracks of 9 different styles, different patterns, different artists, that show you a mere echo of what they have in store for you for the future. We hope you like Yata-Garasu`s next V.A as much as we @ Horrordelic do, so as always - close your eyes , open your mind press play and fly away - to these echoes from the dark. \n\n Keep it real - Keep it original - Keep experimenting.\n\n Thank you for the support & thanks to all the artists involved.",
