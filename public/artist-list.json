Self-taught by nature, he sought to learn more about electronic music for dancefloors, thus originating the beginning of a work in the beach areas of the island since 2015 playing Dubstep. \n\nAfter a while being influenced by Hard Electro and Synthwave styles, he came in 2018 with the first creations, releasing his first authorial song. In 2019 he discovered new trends such as Darkpsy, Hi-Tech and Psycore, and in 2020 he started the first productions within these styles, embracing psycore, emmotionpsy and studying Forestcore.",
